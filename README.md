# -Employee-Attrition-Prediction-Decision-Tree-Model
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) using a Decision Tree Classifier. It aims to help HR teams identify key factors affecting attrition and make data-driven retention strategies.
This project aims to predict employee attrition — whether an employee is likely to leave the company — using a Decision Tree Classifier. The goal is to help HR departments identify key factors influencing attrition and take proactive steps to retain valuable employees.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked for missing or inconsistent data and handled them appropriately.

Encoded categorical variables into numeric values for model compatibility.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored the relationship between variables like age, salary, department, overtime, and job satisfaction.

Created visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, histograms) to identify trends.

Found that low salary, overtime, and low job satisfaction are major contributors to attrition.

🤖 Model Building

Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn.

Tuned hyperparameters like max_depth, criterion, and min_samples_split to improve performance.

Evaluated the model using accuracy score and classification metrics.

🏁 Results

Built an interpretable Decision Tree that clearly highlights key decision paths leading to attrition.

Identified top predictive features such as OverTime, JobSatisfaction, and MonthlyIncome.

Gained valuable insights for HR strategy formulation.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split, metrics)

💡 Key Learnings

Understood how Decision Trees work for classification problems.

Gained practical experience in data preprocessing and visualization.

Learned to interpret decision rules and identify business insights from models.
